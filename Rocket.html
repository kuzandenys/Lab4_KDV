            <p>   Rocket Launcher is another strong weapon V1 can use, firing slow but powerful rockets that
                explode on impact. Basic Rocket Launcher shoots regular explosive rockets, good for groups of
                enemies and big targets. Alternate fire freezes rockets in air. Second variant is S.R.S. Cannon
                â€” it charges up before firing huge, cannon ammo, that does massive damage and bigger explosion,
                but uses more time to shoot. Rockets can also be punched with feedbacker arm to send them flying
                faster and do more damage. Great for clearing rooms, dealing with bosses, and setting up big
                combos with other weapons. While mid-air, by freezing, firing a rocket at a slightly downwards
                angle right before dashing forward and unpausing the rocket, the player can reset their momentum
                and allow the rocket to fly right under their feet, allowing the player to mount a rocket from
                midair and ride it. While costing a stamina bar and being considerably more difficult to execute,
                has no potential to backfire on the player and is very quick to perform.</p>
