            <p>   Next weapon what V1 can acquire is Nailgun, which is fast-firing automatic weapon,
                shooting small nails with insane fire rate. Nails donâ€™t do much damage alone, but together
                they shred enemies in seconds. Basic, blue Nailgun called Attractor Nailgun. Its alternate
                fire shoots magnetic core, which pulls all nails toward it, allowing to focus damage on one
                point or stick nails to flying enemies. Second variant is Overheat Nailgun. It shoots even
                faster and gains heat with every shot. When it overheats, it releases heat blast that pushes
                enemies back and does damage. If you manage heat carefully, you can keep it near max for bonus
                damage. Both versions great for close-range shredding and melting tough enemies. The Attractor
                Nailgun's magnets, although not able to deal damage directly, are a very powerful tool with the
                ability to augment the strength of other weapons in the player's arsenal. As nails are attracted
                by magnets, they can be attached to enemies to greatly mitigate the spread of the Nailgun's
                primary fire and increase overall DPS. They are also useful for damage setups involving charged
                frozen rockets from the Freezeframe Rocket Launcher Freezeframe Rocket Launcher, which can
                otherwise be very difficult to aim directly at enemies.</p>
